//! Audio playback through libmpv.
//!
//! mpv runs the whole network and decode path: ranged chunked reads, reconnection, seeking inside
//! a remote stream, Opus decode and gapless transitions. We only hand it URLs and read back state.
//!
//! State is *polled* rather than delivered through mpv's event context. We already repaint a few
//! times a second while playing, so a handful of property reads on those frames is cheaper and far
//! simpler than running an event thread and a second channel. The same frames drain mpv's event
//! queue without waiting, for one thing only: its own error messages, which go to the log.
